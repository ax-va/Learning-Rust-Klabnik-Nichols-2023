**ownership**

*Ownership* is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory in the *heap*.
If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile.

**prelude**

By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library.
This set, called the *prelude*, will be brought into the scope of every program.
