# The guessing game

- The program should generate a random integer between 1 and 100. 
- It should then prompt the player to enter a guess. 
- After a guess is entered, the program should tell whether the guess is smaller or larger than the generated integer. 
- If the guess is correct, the program should print a congratulatory message and exit.
