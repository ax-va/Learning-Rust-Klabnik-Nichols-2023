# Functional Language Features

## Closures

In Rust, closures are anonymous functions that capture their environment.
We can save in closures a variable or pass them as arguments to other functions.

In Rust, closures usually don't require you to annotate 
the types of their parameters or return values, unlike `fn` functions.
This is because functions are part of an explicit interface 
and their type signatures must be known at the time of declaration, especially when theyâ€™re public.
Closures, on the other hand, are often used locally - stored in variables or passed as arguments - 
and aren't typically exposed as part of a public API.
As a result, the compiler can infer their types from context, so explicit annotations are usually unnecessary.

Compare function and closure definitions with the same behavior
```rust
fn add_one_v1(x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 }; // with the type annotation
let add_one_v3 = |x| { x + 1 }; // without the type annotation
let add_one_v4 = |x| x + 1 ; // The closure body has only one expression
```

For closure definitions, the compiler infers 
a single concrete type for each of their parameters and their return value.
```rust
let example_closure = |x| x;
let s = example_closure(String::from("hello")); // `String` inferred for `x`
// compilation error: "error[E0308]: mismatched types"
// let n = example_closure(5);
//         --------------- ^- help: try using a conversion method: `.to_string()`
//         |               |
//         |               expected `String`, found integer
//         arguments to this function are incorrect
```

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways:
- borrowing immutably
- borrowing mutably
- taking ownership

Put the `move` keyword at the beginning of the closure definition to move ownership of value.
